# Ford_GoBike

The dataset that I choouse was from Ford GoBike. I tried to think questions that are related to how to make more profit out of the data that we have already collected, that is, questions like how to target your main audience with advertisement or in which place we should offer our services (since there is more demand in them).

My main findings from the exploratory analysis are the following:

1) Around 99.9% of people from the data was born after 1940. 
2) The graph of member_birth_year is left skewed with maximum around 1987
3) The distribution of the start and end position are almost identical. With a big concentration around (37.78,-122.40).
